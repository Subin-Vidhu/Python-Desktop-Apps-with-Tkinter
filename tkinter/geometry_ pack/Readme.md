Tkinter has 3 geometry managers

Pack   : add relative to other widgets

Place  : add on (x,y) coordinate

Grid    : add on AxB grid


Pack is one of the geometry managers.

Any widget has a .pack() function

Pack places widgets relative to others

Use only one geometry manager (don't mix pack, place, grid)
